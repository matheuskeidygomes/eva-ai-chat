## API Integration

The application is designed to work with an API that has two endpoints:

- `/chat/text` - For regular text responses
- `/chat/stream` - For streaming responses

Currently, the application uses mock API services that simulate these endpoints. To connect to a real API, modify the functions in `src/lib/api.ts`.
